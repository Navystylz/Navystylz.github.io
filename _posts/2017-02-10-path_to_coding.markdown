My journey to becoming a coder is pretty straight forward. When I was 8 years old I got my first computer. Not sure where it came from anymore, it was old bulky thing that took those 5 1/4" floppy disks. Had no operating system and initially didn't even know how to get the thing to work. Finally got a book on coding in the library and used it to start building programs. Didn't know how to save them at the time so their life only last until turned the computer off.

Few years later I got my first pent 486 and had DOS and windows 3.1 and got into gaming and playing. Learning how to get around that. When the internet craze happened and every house was getting dial up for good prices is when I started to get my first taste of HTML. Learned how to do HTML and would make web pages. From there CSS came out and then got into javascript.

At that point in high school I was taking computer sciences classes and getting into coding with assembly, C++ and Visual basic among other things. Started coding more on my own.

Was in the military for 10.5 years and in the interim I did my own thing hosting forums, boards, some sites and tinkering with code and what not. Once I got out and got into college was taking Computer Information Systems, but all the classes I was taking I already knew the stuff. So felt like it was a waste of money for just a piece of paper. The code speaks for itself and if you have good code then the paper doesn't really matter. I figured you had to have a passion for it to do well, and those that had the passion already knew the stuff that school would tech them unless they had a more focused based, vocational style (bootcamp).

So after changing degrees and finishing school I wanted to expand what I knew with coding. While I could easily learn on my own--the material is readily available--I wanted to give the bootcamp a try. I figured it would allow me to be more focused based and streamline concepts. Once the community based one opened I knew it was time to give it a shot. And here I am.
